# Experiment 17d: Representation of Graph

## Aim
To write a Python program to generate a graph for a given fixed degree sequence.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Start the program**:
   - Read the degree sequence from the user input.
   - The degree sequence represents the number of edges connected to each vertex in the graph.
   
2. **Define the graph representation**:
   - Create an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. The matrix will be a square matrix where each element `mat[i][j]` is `1` if there's an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`, and `0` otherwise.

3. **Construct the graph**:
   - Loop through all pairs of vertices (`i`, `j`).
   - If both vertices `i` and `j` have remaining degrees greater than `0`, decrement their degree and add an edge between them in the matrix.

4. **Display the adjacency matrix**:
   - Print the adjacency matrix in a human-readable format.
   
5. **End the program**:
   - The graph is now represented by the adjacency matrix, and the program prints the matrix.

## Program

```
def printMat(degseq, n):
    mat=[[0]*n for i in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
	    for j in range(i+1,n):
	        if(degseq[i]>0 and degseq[j]>0):
	            degseq[i]-=1
	            degseq[j]-=1
	            mat[i][j]=1
	            mat[j][i]=1
	            
    print("      ", end ="")
    for i in range(n):
	    print(" ", "(", i, ")", end ="")
    print()
    print()
    for i in range(n):
    	print("  ", "(", i, ")", end = " ")
    	for j in range(n):
    		print("  ", mat[i][j], end = " ")
    	print()
degseq=[]
for i in range(0, 5):
    ele = int(input())
    degseq.append(ele)
n = len(degseq)
printMat(degseq, n)
```
